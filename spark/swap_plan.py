"""The arithmetic of Character Swap (spark/spark_swap.py, app/swap.py): the canvas a part is prepared at, the windows a
part is made in, and which pixel frames each of MiniMax H3's latent frames holds. Plain Python, nothing to install.

MiniMax H3 takes 17n + 5 frames at 24 a second (22, 39, ..., 124, ..., 362). Its video latent has 5k + 2 frames for
17k + 5 pixel frames: the first latent frame is one pixel frame, the next four hold four each, and so on in fives
(1, 4, 4, 4, 4, 1, 4, ...). So 17k + 1 pixel frames fill whole latent frames, which is why the history carried from one
window to the next is 18 frames: 17 frames before the join and the frame at the join itself.

A part longer than one window is made in windows of at most 124 frames each, the frames carried in included. The
first starts at the part's first frame. Each later window starts 17 frames before the last frame the window before
delivered: those 17 frames and that last frame (the join) are the previous window's own output, held as they are, and
the window draws what follows, at most 107 frames from the join (17 + 107 = 124), so 106 new frames a window. The last
window is made a little longer than what is left (to the next 17n + 5) and the extra frames at its end are dropped.
