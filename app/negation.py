"""Things a video prompt names in order to forbid them: "no photographs", "without a cut", "never look at the camera".

MiniMax H3 and FastH3 are run here without a negative prompt (they are distilled to one forward a pass, and the
empty side of the guidance is not used), so every word of the prompt is something to show. In a production run a clip
told "No photographs or portraits appear anywhere" hung the wall with photographs, twice, and came out clean once
every mention of photographs was gone; clips told that nobody "NEVER look at the camera" had people turn to it; "No
cut, no close-up" did not stop cuts to close-ups.

`find` lists such phrases so the page can show them before the job is queued. The prompt is the user's: nothing here
changes a sentence they wrote. The app's own prompts no longer forbid anything by name either: a shot without spoken
lines is told "Mouths stay closed." (where it has people) and "Only ambient sound is heard.", a locked camera is "a
locked, still camera" (server.py QUIET_*, slate.py MOVES). The older sentences ("Nobody speaks.", "No voices, no
speech.") are still passed over in a prompt that has them, as are the control-layer lines of a motion reference.

`ensure_ambient` is the other half, for a text or first-frame prompt that never went through the app.
scripts/video.sh (and spark/video.sh, which serves that script on Linux) calls it before the model sees the text.
A prompt with no spoken `<d>` line and no `overall_soundscape:` heading gains the Studio's own ambient line under
that heading. A MiniMax first-frame lead ("For the target video…") stays ahead of the heading, where `compose()`
puts it. A prompt that already has the heading, a spoken line, a reference (`<Picture>`, `<Video>` or `<Audio>`,
or reference files beside the job), `REF_PLAIN=1`, or a reference video's own soundtrack is returned as it was.
