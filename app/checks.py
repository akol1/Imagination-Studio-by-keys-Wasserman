"""AutoPilot's dense checks: many small yes/no questions to the vision brain, decided in code (autopilot.py asks,
this file says what to ask and what the answers mean), and the pace of a piece measured from its pixels.

Why yes/no and why many. On the Viking v2 test film (six 10 s pieces, one Cosmos3-Edge verdict a piece) the eyes were
noisy: a scar was read as a wound, a carved training-dummy face as an extra person, the same picture got different
answers twice, and one answer came back as nested JSON that was read as "no answer" to every question and rendered a
good piece again. So:

  windows   a piece is looked at in windows (``every`` seconds, 2 by default), each a few frames with their times
            (``frames``, 3), not one sheet of eight; the keyframe is looked at before anything moves, and a
            continuation's join (the last frame of the piece before beside this one's first) is a window of its own
  yes/no    each window gets short questions built from the continuity bible (is Eirik still the man in the
            reference? does he wear the brown coat? is this the cobbled street? anything from a later era? does a person
            turn into another?), each answered "yes" or "no"; pass or fail is decided here, against the answer the bible
            expects. A missing answer (or an "unclear" given anyway) is never a failure; an answer that is not JSON, or that
            answers less than ``ANSWERED`` of the questions, is asked again
  votes     a failed question of a major kind is asked again on its own, ``votes`` times in all, and fails only by a
            majority of the yes/no answers; the second look of autopilot.second_look still has the last word
  pace      a fight or an action piece is measured (the mean difference between frames, a second at a time) and the
            eyes are asked "is this slow motion?" in each window; a piece the Director planned fast that comes out slow
            throughout fails with a pace finding

Every request is logged with its window, questions, answers, votes and seconds (``log``), so the page and the run's
report say how many checks ran and what each found.
