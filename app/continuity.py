"""The continuity bible: AutoPilot's recursive, memory-backed continuity (autopilot.py asks the questions, this file
keeps the answers and decides what they mean).

Every segment is checked against everything the film has established so far, not only the segment before. The bible
(``bible.json`` in the run's folder, ``bible/S0001.json`` after each segment) holds the canonical state:

  subjects   the people, places and things, with their names and a reference picture (a cast picture, else the
             clearest frame of their first segment)
  facts      one attribute each (who, category, key, value), versioned: a fact holds from one segment to another, and a
             new value closes the old one instead of overwriting it, so the bible can say what was true when
  eras       a time-skip or another era (a cast sheet that starts later, or the Director's ``era``): era-scoped facts
             (age, hair, build, wardrobe, props, era rules) close at an era change, film-scoped ones (face, eyes, scars
             and marks, voice, places, story) carry on
  scene      scene-scoped facts (who is where on screen, which way they move, actions in progress, light, music and
             ambience) close when a new scene starts
  story      what has happened (the watcher's events and the story facts it reports): never folded, never dropped
  corrections  the minor findings the Director is told to put right in the next segment

The scene graph's chapter fold (autopilot.commit) folds only event detail; nothing here is folded.

The check of a segment (autopilot.check_continuity) is one checklist question to the vision brain: a verdict a
category (ok, minor, major, not visible) with the frame and the evidence. ``triage`` turns that into findings: a
finding without evidence, or whose evidence says nothing is wrong, is dropped; a major one is looked at again, closer
(autopilot.second_look), and dropped when the second look does not see it. What a confirmed major does depends on the
run's strictness (``STRICTNESS``): a retake with the finding in the Director's hands, or a correction for the next
segment.
